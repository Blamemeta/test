# test
A repository for testing concepts and the like. Hello World basically.

TUI.c is an extemely basic Text User Interface. It simply allows for text menus.

Arrowkey.c allows for testing of various keys. It's called arrowkey because i needed to test arrowkeys, but it works for all keys

txtedit.c was supposed to a text editor. Never really went anywhere.

structures is just a couple of basic structures. Not really much more.

Magic.c is just a basic utility file. It'll get bigger as time goes on probably.
